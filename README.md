<div id="content">
  <h2>About Puzhal Lake</h2>
  <p>The Puzhal Lake, originally a small tank built during the British rule in Chennai (then named Madras), has undergone significant expansion and modifications over the years to serve as a crucial water source for the city.</p>
  <h3>History and Development</h3>
  <p>The reservoir, constructed in 1876, initially had a capacity of 500 million cubic feet (mcft) and featured two masonry weirs made of locally available laterite stones. These weirs served as surplus weirs to release excess water from the reservoir. In 1997, the storage capacity was increased to 3,300 mcft, and the depth was increased to 21.20 ft to meet the growing water demands of Chennai.</p>
  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The reservoir spans an area of approximately 7,600 acres.</li>
    <li>It features two masonry weirs, one measuring 178 m long and the other 220 m long.</li>
    <li>The bund surrounding the reservoir is 5 m high and extends for a distance of 7 km.</li>
    <li>Several villages and residential localities are situated around the reservoir.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Jones Tower</h3>
  <p>Constructed in 1881, Jones Tower serves to measure the depth of the lake water. The surrounding bund roads are popular among locals for recreational activities such as walking and running.</p>
  <h3>Water Seepage and Upgradation</h3>
  <p>In 2015, water seepage occurred due to heavy rainfall, prompting maintenance and repair efforts. Upgradation projects have also been undertaken, including strengthening the reservoir bund and enhancing filter arrangements.</p>
